BlazeHtml is a blazingly fast HTML combinator library for the [Haskell]
programming language. It embeds HTML templates in Haskell code for optimal
efficiency and composability.  To get started, just

    cabal install blaze-html

[Haskell]: http://haskell.org/

The project is aimed at those who seek to write web applications in Haskell --
it integrates well with all Haskell web frameworks.

The best way to get started with BlazeHtml is to have a look at our [tutorial].

# Status

The BlazeHtml API is considered stable, however, the implementation is still
experimental. We like to encourage you to try it and tell us what you think, and
submit possible bugs to the [issue tracker] (if you do not have a GitHub
account, [contact us by mail](/about.html#contact)).
