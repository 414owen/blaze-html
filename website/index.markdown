BlazeHtml is a blazingly fast HTML combinator library for the [Haskell]
programming language. It embeds HTML templates in Haskell code for optimal
efficiency and composability.  To get started, just

    cabal install blaze-html

[Haskell]: http://haskell.org/

--- column2

The project is aimed at those who seek to write web applications in Haskell --
it integrates well with all Haskell web frameworks.

The best way to get started with BlazeHtml is to have a look at our [tutorial].

# Features

- Pretty fast -- have a look at [our benchmarks]
- Lightweight DSL syntax
- Embedded in Haskell
- Efficient Unicode support

[our benchmarks]: $root/benchmarks.html

# Status

BlazeHtml is currently in a very experimental state. Upcoming releases have a
good chance to break your code. Nevertheless, we like to encourage you to try
it and tell us what you think, and submit possible bugs to the [issue tracker].

# Google Summer of Code

Jasper Van der Jeugt is working on this project for [Google Summer of Code]
2010. This means we have made a roadmap for this summer:

[Google Summer of Code]: http://code.google.com/soc/

- Initial release.
- Fix implementation such that it works for outputting UTF-8 encoded
  `ByteString`, `Text`, and `String`.
- Add further HTML, XHTML variants depending on requests.
- Document and, where possible, package implementation techniques such that
  other projects can use them; e.g. faster binary builder, `Utf8Builder`,
  `TextBuilder`, and `StaticMultiString`.
- If time remains: Write a BlazeHtml generator translating an HTML page to the
  corresponding BlazeHtml haskell code. This greatly simplifies initial imports
  and importing of new snippets.

# Code

If you are interested, all code is available on [GitHub].
